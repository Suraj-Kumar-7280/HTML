to the content it contains.

<header>:-  Contains introductory content 
<article>:- Encapsulates a self-contained composition
<footer>:-  Holds footer information
<section>: Represents a standalone section
<aside>: Contains content aside from the content it is placed in
<nav>: Holds navigation links
<main>: Defines the main content of a web page
 
üñäÔ∏ènon-semantic tag:- A non-semantic tag in HTML is a tag that organizes content without 
providing any specific meaning about the content.
                    examples
<div>: A generic container for flow content, such as a section of a page 
<span>: A generic inline container for phrasing content, such as highlighted text

            <br>Nagashadhu story:- The heart of a dense forest, nestled between 
            the hills and the thick trees, lived a creature named Nagashadhu. 
            Known only in whispered tales, it was said to be a being both feared and revered. 
            It was a serpent, but not like any ordinary snake. Its scales shimmered like gold, 
            and its eyes glowed with the wisdom of ages. It was believed to be a guardian of the 
            forest, a protector of secrets and mysteries.

            Long ago, the village at the edge of the forest had been thriving, 
            with farmers and traders walking in and out, taking what 
            they needed from the forest and giving it back in turn. But as the years 
            passed, the villagers grew greedy. They began taking more than they needed‚Äîcutting down 
            trees, hunting animals for sport, and poisoning the waters. The balance of nature began to 
            shift, and with it, something dark began to stir in the heart of the forest.
